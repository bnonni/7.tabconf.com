# TABConf 6 Call for Speakers Open

We are organizing the TABConf 6 on Github issues.

If you are interested in giving a talk, workshop, or panel, you must open a GitHub issue in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/7.tabconf.com/issues/new/choose">repo</a>. 
You do NOT need to be a developer to open a GitHub Issue for a talk, workshop, or panel submission. You only need a GitHub profile and some time.

Please be as detailed as possible when opening your issue because this is how talks, panels, and workshops for TABConf 6 will be selected. Your submission is public, so anyone can also read your submission, ask questions, and vote on it by using the emojis on Github. 

Here is a great example issue you can check out: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/2023.tabconf.com/issues/34">workshop example</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TABConf/2023.tabconf.com/issues/96">talk example</a>.

Submissions that are chosen will be added to the TABConf 6 GitHub Project, which is what we are going to use as our: 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/orgs/TABConf/projects/9">official schedule</a>.

Here are some of the reasons we are trying this out for 6.
- We want to provide more transparency for the workshop, speaker, and panel selections. 
- We want attendees to have the ability to ask questions and have conversations about the submissions before the conference
- We want to push attendees to research submissions by reviewing GitHub repos before they attend TABConf. 
- We want to keep TABConf a technically-focused conference, and pushing attendees to GitHub may help people learn about the different projects and repos in the space.
