# Base58's Protocol Village

## [Base58 Protocol Schedule](https://github.com/orgs/TABConf/projects/1/views/9)

## Village focused on protocols in the Bitcoin space, including:

- bitcoin
- nostr
- lightning
- cryptography

## Our village will consist of:

- protocol implementation walkthrus,
- the World Famous Bitcoin Live-Action Role-Play (LARP),
- a protocol design competition
- some live-coding demos from protocol focused projects
- talks from protocol developers across the ecosystem

### Project Details
This will be a village run and hosted by Base58, a bitcoin protocol academy. Last year we ran a live-coding demo at TABConf. This year, we'd like to do this in addition to more hands-on learning opportunities.
