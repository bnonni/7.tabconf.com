# Lightning Village

## [Lightning Schedule](https://github.com/orgs/TABConf/projects/1/views/8)

There’s no better way to experience the Lightning Network in action than to stack some sats playing video games. But that’s not all the Shadowy Super Coders & Gamers Village has to offer at TABConf 6!

At the Gaming Village, you’ll enter a next-generation arcade with a mix of mobile and PC gaming. Experience Bitcoin gaming first hand, then stick around to discuss the tech and the implications of Bitcoin Lightning tech on the gaming industry and the virtual economies of the future!

This is where you go to hang out and have some sat-stacking fun after all those serious talks and workshops. Eor do youxpect some serious(ly cool) content alongside the games!
