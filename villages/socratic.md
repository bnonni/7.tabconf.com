# BitDevs Socratic Village

## [Bitdevs Socratic Village Schedule](https://github.com/orgs/TABConf/projects/1/views/7)

This year’s Socratic Village is a collaboration! This village is geared towards those interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols.

### What can I expect from the BitDevs Socratic Village?

The Socratic Village is based on the concept of a Socratic Seminar/Circle, a collaborative dialogue that is facilitated by participants examining a subject or text and articulating their questions and viewpoints. The group setting helps participants construct meaning through analysis, interpretation, listening and active engagement in conversation. 

Content in the Socratic Village will be a combination of Socratic Sessions with general themes and topic-specific Socratic Panels. The Socratic Sessions will be a condensed version of a Socratic-style meetup. A discussion leader will curate some content based on a general theme and come prepared to give background on the material and provide discussion questions for the group.

### Example themes for the sessions include:

- bitcoin and lightning protocol development.
- novel layer 2 protocols.
- cryptography.
- security and privacy.

The interactive panels will be driven by small group of experts on a specific subject matter. The panels should be two way, in that the panelists should expect to field questions from the community as well as have their own questions to stimulate discussion. Example topics for the panels include covenants, privacy on lightning, routing optimizations, liquidity advertisements, attacks on lightning, hot wallet management, how to build applications on lightning, pegging mechanisms, simplicity, DLCs, MEV, and how to lead a Socratic meetup.

We’ll also have some technical trivia and other fun activities planned!
